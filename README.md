<h3 align=center>Glide freely, without extra bloat</h3>

---

> ## What is it?
- This module installs the proprietary Google Glide Typing library `libjni_latinimegoogle.so` to your system
- It does it systemlessly (which is cool)
- This module is recommended to be used alongside a microG installation 

The .so file is extracted from OpenGapps.
